//! Interpolation of intermediate values of functions

/**
Interpolates an intermediate value of a function from three of it's
given values

# Returns

* `interpol_val`: Intermediate value of the function

# Arguments

* `y1`: Value 1 of the function
* `y2`: Value 2 of the function
* `y3`: Value 3 of the function
* `n` : Interpolating factor, measured from the central value
        `y2`, positively towards `y3`
**/
